# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Please do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Reporting
- Use GitHub Security Advisories to privately disclose issues.
- If that is not available, email the maintainer at security@mhiskall.com (placeholder) with details and reproduction steps.

## Expectations
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a remediation plan or timeline after triage.
- Please give us a reasonable window to patch before public disclosure.

## Scope
- Clarity contracts and supporting tooling in this repository.
- Third-party dependencies should be reported upstream when possible, but feel free to notify us if they affect this project.
